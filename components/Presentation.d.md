## Introduction

 -What is our product?  what IS IT going to achieve `(As the a)`
    -> Source reliability - We are getting our data from an internationlly renown and highly peer reviewed (with an excellent track record) api 
    -> Time -> 
    -> It is pretty much impossible for any errors to occur (in a bank for example you have multiple individuals working on a summary where errors can occur at any step in the process )
    -> Up to date unbiased information

 -What is our target audience`(The average investor, bank clients, Relationship Managers and the bank itself)`





## Technology 
    -> How does it work?  Explained in steps 
    1. Truthful Crypto news API -> it gives us a list of websites containing all kinds of crypto related information
    2. Our web crawler goes on each of these sites and downloads the entire html content
    3. Our turbo-3.5 model is then trained with downloaded content
    4. The EyeHawk frontend calls a python api which returns a response from our pre-trained model no special input parameters (default presence and frequency penalties etc. etc.)
    5. Our mobile app is for our customers who are often on the go
    6. Nice to have -> An AI generated newsletter based on the current crypto market findings, which is automatically sent to our clients per mail


## Types of questions to ask our chat bot
    
    "Can you give a detailed summary about crypto news on the last day that you have information on?"

    The key is to ask questions where the desired response is a detailed summary about individual products, not questions such as ("should I invest into X or Y")
    
    The goal is to have a fast responding and highly accurate source of financially related information, to help us as clients to make highly informed choices.

'Business Viability -> '
User Desirability 
    -> 
Product Marketability

Product Feasability 
    -> Given what we currently have for the demo (achieved in 4 hours) - we are beyond confident that we are capable of taking over the market by storm in an extremely efficient manner with our product.
    -> 6 months in order to generate 1.4 mio profit 
    
    Product development cost -> 180'000 CHF 

    estimated revenue -> 0.05% of every billable hour per bank employee using the application 
    -> 0.05% of 100'000 CHF per year per employee -> 50 CHF per year per employee -> 50 CHF x 100'000 employees -> 5 mio CHF per year -> 5 mio CHF x 0.05% -> 2.5 mio CHF per year -> 2.5 mio CHF x 6 months -> 1.25 mio CHF per 6 months -> 1.25 mio CHF / 180'000 CHF -> 6.94 -> 6.94 x 100% -> 694% ROI in 6 months
    ("Chat gpt came up with this calculation so let's take it with a grain of salt.)


    Calculate how many hour per click they are saving, then at the end of the month collect all the click and bill the 40% of the hour.
    
    Q: Is it possible to attract a partner or investor for this solution?
    A: Given the fact that the proposed development timeline is 6 months x 1 BA and 2 Developers (1 FE + 1 BE) -> the proposed cost is going to be negligible and thus
    easy to find people willing to invest 180'000 CHF**
